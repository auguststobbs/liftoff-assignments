## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our group’s app will help manage cleaning services for properties with benefits both to property owners and to cleaners. The idea for this project came from a friend of the group who runs a residential/commercial cleaning service company, but currently manages all business data manually on paper. The app will allow the business owner to manage customer data in a more organized way and stimulate business by providing customers with features such as cost estimations, visual organization of properties, a calendar interface displaying scheduled cleaning appointments, and reminders about upcoming appointments.
